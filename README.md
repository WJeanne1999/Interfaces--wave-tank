Interfaces Project wave tank

I explored the concept of bringing the positive effects of nature indoors through interfaces,
particularly focusing on replicating the impacts of the sea within indoor spaces. 
Motivated by the notion of biophilia and research on nature-based therapies, and inspired by theories such as Attention Restoration Theory 
and Stress Reduction Theory to understand the profound impact of nature on human well-being.
Additionally, I investigate the potential benefits of using brown noise to enhance focus, especially for individuals with ADHD.

Furthermore, I examined how technology has been used to mimic natural environments for therapeutic purposes,
citing examples such as light therapy devices and visual weather displays. Inspired by these advancements, 
Creating my own interface â€”a wave tank controlled by an Arduino to visualize surf forecasts indoors.

Despite encountering challenges with coding and integrating APIs, I developed a prototype that simulates waves.
With the ultimate goal of simulating the positive impacts of outdoors, indoors.
